#About this branch:
The focus of this branch is to make the code easyer to maintain, document it and make it work properly with UTF-8 encoding.
This will mainly be done by making the code style comply with PEAR style. The framework will expect UTF-8 as the internal encoding. Depricated code and non OOP code will be removed and be replaced with OOP code.

#HOW TO INSTALL

* Make sure you have the PHP5 CLI installed (on Ubuntu install the "php5-cli"-package).
* Now run the install-file "sudo php5 install_knjphpframework.php". This will create symlinks in "/usr/share/php5", "usr/share/php4" and "/usr/share/php"..


#HOW TO USE

* After running the setup-script, you can include a part of the framework like this:
<?php
	require_once("knjphpframwork/functions_knj_extensions.php");
?>


You can then use the functions of the part like this:
<?php
   if (!knj_dl("gtk2)){
   	die("Could not load the PHP5-GTK2-module.\n");
   }
?>
